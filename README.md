# NPCLootClaim-Continued
A continuation of Vintar's NPC Loot Claim addon for STALKER Anomaly.
  
## Description
A dead NPC is first claimed by the killer's squad.  
If the killer's squad is wiped, then the body is claimed by allies of the victim and killer simultaneously.  
If none exist within range, then the body is unclaimed and the actor can loot freely.  
Actor's kills are never claimed by NPCs.
